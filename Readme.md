# SBS Test

Only had an hour to do this so I couldn't do any css animations etc.

Most of code spent in this hour was in components/Panels. Rest is mostly boilerplate.

## Prerequisites 

- OSX or a standard Linux distribution 
- Node.js 12+, I recommend installing Node via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

## Setup

`npm install`

## Run

`npm dev`

## Test

`npm test`
